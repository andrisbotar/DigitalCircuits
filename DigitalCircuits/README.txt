blockdiag for drawing circuit_diagrams: http://blockdiag.com/en/

CONTAINED FILES:
digital_circuits.cpp and digitalcircuits.h: Central file containing main function, demonstration cases, etc..
circuit.cpp and circuit.h: Defines a class for storing a circuit with multiple inputs, outputs, update functionality..
components.cpp and Components.h: Contains digital circuit components such as AND gates, OR gates, buffers...
utility.cpp and utility.h: Contains various utility functions for creating truth tables, printing tables,printing vectors...
draw.cpp and draw.h Uses the "blockdiag" program to output images of the circuits
other_classes.cpp and other_classes.h: miscelaneous classes and variables
common.h: a shared header for all files, defines global variables
